## OJT Tracker

A small Windows console application for managing On‑the‑Job Training (OJT) information. The app is packaged with PyInstaller and ships with an executable plus JSON data files.

### What's in this repo

- `dist/`
  - `ojt_tracker.exe`: Packaged Windows executable
  - `ojt_data.json`, `ojt_info.json`: App data files (created/updated by the app)
  - `Pag-IBIG.ico`: Icon file present alongside the build (not embedded by default)
- `build/`: Intermediate build artifacts (generated by PyInstaller)
- `ojt_tracker.spec`: PyInstaller spec used to reproduce the build

### Run the app (Windows)

You can run the packaged app directly; no Python installation required.

1. Open Windows PowerShell in the project directory
2. Run:

```powershell
cd .\dist
./ojt_tracker.exe
```

Notes:
- This is a console application (`console=True`), so it runs in a terminal window.
- The app reads/writes data next to the executable in `dist/`.

### Data files

- `ojt_data.json` and `ojt_info.json` store the application's saved information.
- Back up these files before replacing or cleaning the `dist/` folder if you want to keep existing data.
- To reset the app, close it and delete these JSON files; they will be recreated on next run.

### Rebuild from source

This project is bundled with a PyInstaller spec. To reproduce the build:

1. Install Python (3.8+ recommended) and pip
2. In a terminal at the project root, install PyInstaller:

```powershell
pip install pyinstaller
```

3. Build using the provided spec file:

```powershell
pyinstaller --clean --noconfirm ojt_tracker.spec
```

Artifacts will appear under `build/` and `dist/`. The executable will be at `dist/ojt_tracker.exe`.

Optional: build without the spec (uses defaults similar to the spec):

```powershell
pyinstaller --name ojt_tracker --console ojt_tracker.py
```

If you want to embed a custom icon into the executable, add an icon to the spec or CLI:

```powershell
pyinstaller --name ojt_tracker --console --icon Pag-IBIG.ico ojt_tracker.py
```

### Development (run from source)

If you have the source file `ojt_tracker.py` available, you can run it directly:

```powershell
python ojt_tracker.py
```

Data persistence behavior may differ depending on the working directory. By default, JSON files are created in the current working directory.

### Clean build outputs

To start from a clean state, you can delete generated folders and rebuild:

```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .\build, .\dist
pyinstaller --clean --noconfirm ojt_tracker.spec
```

### Troubleshooting

- If Windows flags the executable as unrecognized, you may need to click "More info" > "Run anyway" or unblock the file in Properties.
- If the app cannot write JSON files, run the terminal as a user with write permissions to the `dist/` folder.
